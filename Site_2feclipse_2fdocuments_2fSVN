This screen will vary depending on the features you have installed already. You want to click on the New Remote Site button.

=== Step 12 ===
Finally, after restarting Eclipse, the first thing you will typically want to do is open the Subclipse Repository perspective where you can define your repositories. Be sure to also check the online help as well as the Subclipse preferences located under Team -&gt; SVN.
