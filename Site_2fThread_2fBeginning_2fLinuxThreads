<H1>The LinuxThreads library</H1>

LinuxThreads is an implementation of the Posix 1003.1c thread package
for Linux.<P>

Unlike other implementations of Posix threads for Linux, LinuxThreads provides
<strong>kernel-level</strong> threads: threads are created with the new
<tt>clone()</tt> system call and all scheduling is done in the kernel.
<P>

The main strength of this approach is that it can take full advantage of
multiprocessors. It also results in a simpler, more robust thread library,
especially w.r.t. blocking system calls.
<P>

For more information, see the <A HREF="LinuxThreadReadme">LinuxThreads README</A>
and the <A HREF="FAQ">LinuxThreads Frequently Asked Questions</A>.
<P>

<H3>Warning</H3>

LinuxThreads is now obsolete and is being replaced by <A
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPTL">NPTL</A>.  The initial
author of LinuxThreads (Xavier Leroy) stopped working on LinuxThreads
a long time ago.  The glibc development team, in particular Ulrich
Drepper, continued working on LinuxThreads for a while, but are now
developing NPLT instead.<P>

The information on this Web page has not been updated in a
while and may not be 100% up to date.
The <A HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/glibc/">glibc mailing lists</A>
often contain more up-to-date information.<P>

General questions about LinuxThreads and programming with POSIX
threads should be posted on the <code>comp.programming.threads</code>
newsgroup.<P>

Bug reports should be sent directly to the glibc development team
using the <code>glibcbug</code> script that is installed on your
machine along with glibc itself.<P>

<H3>Obtaining LinuxThreads</H3>

<B>For Linux systems based on glibc 2 (e.g. RedHat 5.0 and later)</B>:
the <tt>glibc</tt> 2 version of LinuxThreads is distributed along with
<tt>glibc</tt> 2 itself.
If you have installed a Linux distribution based on <tt>glibc</tt> 2
(such as RedHat 5.0 and later, or indeed most major Linux
distributions these days), you already have LinuxThreads on your 
computer.  Congratulations.  Otherwise, both <tt>glibc</tt> 2 and the
associated LinuxThreads distribution can be found on <A
HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/glibc/">Cygnus/RedHat source collection</A>,
and also on <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html">any FTP site
that mirrors GNU software</A> (the Cygnus/RedHat site is sometimes more
up-to-date than the GNU sites).<P>

<B>For Linux systems based on libc 5 (e.g. old versions of Slackware)</B>:
The source distribution of LinuxThreads for libc 5 is
available at <A HREF="ftp://ftp.inria.fr/INRIA/Projects/cristal/Xavier.Leroy/linuxthreads.tar.gz"><tt>ftp://ftp.inria.fr/INRIA/Projects/cristal/Xavier.Leroy/linuxthreads.tar.gz</tt></A>.
Please note that the libc 5 version of LinuxThreads is obsolete and
no longer maintained.  An upgrade to glibc 2 is highly recommended for
reliable multithreading programming.<P>

<B>Debugging threaded programs with GDB:</B>
Recent versions of gdb and glibc support the debugging of
multithreaded programs.  For instance, RedHat 6.2 and later come with
a thread-aware version of gdb.<P>

For older systems: see <A HREF="ftp://ftp.valinux.com/pub/support/hjl/gdb/">H.J.Lu's patches</A> for gdb, which include thread support and more.
The very first attempt at multi-threaded debugging for LinuxThreads
was the <A HREF="gdb-4.17-debug-threads.patch.gz">patches for gdb 4.17</A>
developed at The Open Group, Grenoble, but this is now largely obsolete.
The Open Group patches are for glibc 2.  Kaz Kylheku back-ported them to
libc 5: <A HREF="linuxthreads-0.71.patch">patch for LinuxThreads 0.71/libc5</A>
and <A HREF="gdb-4.17.patch">patch for GDB 4.17</A>.<P>
